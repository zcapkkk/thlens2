# Spot Focusing Coma Correction in the Terahertz Region

The following are the code used for simulating the propagation of a horn source through different lenses onto an imaging plane.

### hornoptimonefocuslens.m

Optimised one lens to perform focusing. Demonstrates that while some correction is achieved, there are large airy disks with high intensity present in 0 degrees.

### hornoptim_focus1.m

Optimised the aperture lens to be used in conjunction with a regular lens. Demonstrates good correction of coma across all angles up to 60 degrees.
